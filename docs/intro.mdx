# QuestKit

QuestKit is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to create quests for your players to complete. It is designed to be powerful and flexible.
Note that QuestKit is still in development, and is not yet ready for use.

## Differences from other quest plugins

Unlike most other plugins, QuestKit gives complete control over the questing system via Kotlin scripts. This allows you to create quests that are more complex and interesting than what is possible with other plugins.
